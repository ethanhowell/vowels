# Vowels
## About
Vowels is a new esoteric programming language where the only valid symbols are vowels, and all other characters are ignore. Therefore, it can be embedded into programs for other languages, creating multi-lingual programs. The Vowels interpreter is written in ANSI C, so it can run on nearly every platform ever made.

## Installation
To install the Vowels interpreter, simply clone the repository (found at https://github.com/ethanhowell/vowels) and run 'make'. This will create the _vowels_ binary in the current directory.

## Use
To run a Vowels program, simply run `./vowels path/to/program` in the directory where the _vowels_ binary exists. Alternatively, if the Vowels Interpreter is installed, you may use a shebang line in the program and run it by making _program_ executable and running it directly.

## Bug Reports
The Vowels Interpreter is a new piece of software, and as such, may have numerous bugs. To report these, visit https://github.com/ethanhowell/vowels/issues/new or send an email to the maintaner at ethanhowell@users.noreply.github.com.

## Using the Language
